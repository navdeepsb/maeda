# (Project) Maeda

A project dedicated to [John Maeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda "John Maeda wiki") by exploiting programming & graphic design. My knowledge about the guy might be limited but it was enough to spark the light in me to (try to) connect programming and graphic design into something more pleasing. Life is, after all, about finding and sharing happiness...

- __[Trees](https://rawgit.com/navdeepsb/maeda/master/01-trees/)__<br /><img src="previews/trees-summer.png" width="420" height="420" /><br />An attempt to capture the swaying of a tree. Personally inspired from a tree in my backyard that I kept watch on for the entire snowy winter. It was relieving to see it leave its barren form and sway in its full foliage in the spring air _#WIP #TODO_
